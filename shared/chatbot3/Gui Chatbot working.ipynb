      "\n",
      "Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inherited breast cancer\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors estimate that about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers are linked to gene mutations passed through generations of a family.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of inherited mutated genes that can increase the likelihood of breast cancer have been identified. The most well-known are breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2), both of which significantly increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a strong family history of breast cancer or other cancers, your doctor may recommend a blood test to help identify specific mutations in BRCA or other genes that are being passed through your family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider asking your doctor for a referral to a genetic counselor, who can review your family health history. A genetic counselor can also discuss the benefits, risks and limitations of genetic testing to assist you with shared decision-making.\n",

      "Risk factors\n",
      "\n",
      "A breast cancer risk factor is anything that makes it more likely you'll get breast cancer. But having one or even several breast cancer risk factors doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop breast cancer. Many women who develop breast cancer have no known risk factors other than simply being women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Factors that are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer include:\n",

      "Being female. Women are much more likely than men are to develop breast cancer.\n",

      "If you've had breast cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other breast. A family history of breast cancer.

nipple\\n\\nPeeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin\\n\\nRedness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange\\n\\nWhen to see a doctor\\n\\nIf you find a lump or other change in your breast — even if a recent mammogram was normal — make an appointment with your doctor for prompt evaluation.', 'Causes\\n\\nDoctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally.', 'These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass.', 'Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.', 'Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma).', 'Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.', 'Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer.', \"But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do.\", \"It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.\", 'Inherited breast cancer\\n\\nDoctors estimate that about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers are linked to gene mutations passed through generations of a family.', 'A number of inherited mutated genes that can increase the likelihood of breast cancer have been identified.', 'The most well-known are breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2), both of which significantly increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.', 'If you have a strong family history of breast cancer or other cancers, your doctor may recommend a blood test to help identify specific mutations in BRCA or other genes that are being passed through your family.', 'Consider asking your doctor for a referral to a genetic counselor, who can review your family health history.', 'A genetic counselor can also discuss the benefits, risks and limitations of genetic testing to assist you with shared decision-making.', \"Risk factors\\n\\nA breast cancer risk factor is anything that makes it more likely you'll get breast cancer.\", \"But having one or even several breast cancer risk factors doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop breast cancer.\", 'Many women who develop breast cancer have no known risk factors other than simply being women.', 'Factors that are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer include:\\n\\nBeing female.', 'Women are much more likely than men are to develop breast cancer.', 'Women are much more likely than men are to
